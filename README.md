This is the Github repo for my website http://tepatti.com

Originally, I was using some hipstery bootstrap theme, and all was well, but it was boring.

I decided that I'd had enough of all this hipster parallax scrolling and the rest of that junk, and decided to make my own little unique website that I truly feel is an extension of me and my personality.

Feel free to check out the source code, I also hid a lot of random goodies everywhere.
