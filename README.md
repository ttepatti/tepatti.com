This is my website. I'm a big fan of static websites, so it's all written by hand.

The previous version of my website was written in Markdown and then compiled into static HTML web pages using [Stasis Generator](https://github.com/Gioni06/stasis-generator), but this became a bit too tedious to maintain. Also, I'm not a big fan of Node :P

My main reason for switching to this method of development and deployment is so that I can maintain a proper blog without all of the vulnerability that comes with running a full dynamic blogging platform like Wordpress or similar.

## Testing

python3 -m http.server

## Version

This is now the sixth major revision of my website.
