This is my website. I'm a big fan of static websites, so it's all written in Markdown and then compiled into static HTML web pages using [Stasis Generator](https://github.com/Gioni06/stasis-generator)

My main reason for switching to this method of development and deployment is so that I can maintain a proper blog without all of the vulnerability that comes with running a full dynamic blogging platform like Wordpress or similar.

## Version

This is technically version 5 of my website. Version 4 was never published, so you could also think of this as v4+, but I prefer a strong distinction since I've now moved to a node-based development cycle.
