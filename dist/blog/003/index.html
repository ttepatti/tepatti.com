<p>Recently, I was attempting to flash an operating system onto my PC Engines APU1 system.</p>
<p>Part of that involved following PC Engines' instructions on flashing TinyCore Linux onto a USB device to later install on the APU1.</p>
<p>Interestingly, their instructions specified using syslinux to make the flash drive bootable. Maybe it's because I'm a young'in, but I've never had to make a flash drive bootable by hand before! My usual go-to is just dd-ing a premade ISO image straight to a block device, running 'sync' to make sure everything is good, and popping it out.</p>
<p>I read some documentation on syslinux, and it seemed to be as easy as running 'syslinux -i /dev/sdX1' on the flash drive!</p>
<p>I checked /dev/ but only found a listing for sdb, not sdb1. "Should be fine," I thought to myself, and pushed ahead.</p>
<pre><code>syslinux -i /dev/sdb

Error: Device Temporarily Unavailable
</code></pre>
<p>Uhh, what? What made it break?</p>
<p>I searched far and wide but couldn't find anything. What could be wrong? I tried formatting my USB a number of times, with different filesystems, everything I could think of. Nothing would get it working!</p>
<p>But then I remembered.</p>
<p>I used sdb, not sdb1.</p>
<p>Why didn't my flashdrive have a '1' after the block device?</p>
<p>Because it's missing a partition table!</p>
<p>I whipped open gparted, selected /dev/sdb, and clicked 'Device' -> 'Create Partition Table'. Created the partition table, assigned the free space to a new FAT16 partition, and what do you know? The new FAT16 partition is /dev/sdb1!</p>
<p>I ran syslinux again</p>
<pre><code>syslinux -i /dev/sdb1
</code></pre>
<p>No error messages! I browsed the flash drive, and what do you know! It has ldlinux.sys and ldlinux.c32, the two syslinux files that I needed. Sweet!</p>
<p>From here, all I had to do was copy the files out of TinyCore6.4_2017.tar.bz2 and into the root of the flash drive. Now, my flash drive contained:</p>
<pre><code>autostart.sh
core.gz
ldlinux.c32
ldlinux.sys
syslinux.cfg
vmlinuz
</code></pre>
<p>Sweet, that's everything I need! Pop it into the APU1, and everything boots up as it should! (Note: I had to plug it into the LOWER USB port to get it to work. It did not work in the upper USB port, for some reason.)</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps out someone else who has issues with syslinux or setting up TinyCore Linux on a PC Engines APU.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
