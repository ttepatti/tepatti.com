		My Honeypots
		<br /><br />
		I've recently become a big fan of honeypots. They're great tools for a huge variety of reasons - you can run one on your company or home network to catch intruders,
		you can use them on the public web to get fresh malware samples and password cracking dictionaries, and they can even help with tracking botnet activity across the web.
		<br /
		When I first became interested them I bought a copy of the Malware Analyst's Cookbook and DVD, but I knew next to nothing about Linux or malware back then, so the book
		sat unused on my shelf for a few years. Around 2016 the itch to analyze malware hit me again and I picked it back up, starting at Page 1 and reading the whole thing through.
		I absorbed 10x more information the second time through, and decided I'd set up a simple SSH/Telnet honeypot on an unused VPS I had.
		<br />
		My honeypot of choice thusfar has been Cowrie, a great SSH/Telnet honeypot coded by Michel Oosterhof. It's served me well and I've been able to collect hundreds of new malware
		samples and login attempts to the honeypot.
		<br />
		I run Cowrie on a simple Debian VPS. My VPS has a bash script hourly cron job that will copy everything in cowrie's dl/ directory (Captured samples/binaries) and logs/ directory
		(Cowrie logs) to my home server's FTP. This is for a few reasons: 
		<br />
		- I get to keep my samples if my VPS host ever goes down unexpectedly
		<br />
		- I get to keep my samples/logs if my VPS is compromised
		<br />
		- I have all of the samples on my home server, meaning I can transfer them to my analysis rig extremely quickly
