		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			Hello! My name is Tim, and I love computers. Everything about them, head to
			toe, start to finish. Old or new, weird or plain. I created this website to
			show off my personal projects, hobbies, and collections of interesting information!
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a huge passion for computers, GNU/Linux, security, video games, retro
			computing, programming, networking, web design, anime, manga, cars, "JDM"
			culture, drifting, and so so much more. If any of that sounds cool to you,
			I highly recommend checking out my <a href="/projects/index.html">various
			projects!</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This website doesn't take itself too seriously, so don't be too surprised by
			the various designs or layouts. I made it for fun, because I love writing
			websites by hand :) For more information, you can check out the
			<a href="/projects/webdesign.html">web design page.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel free to explore and have fun! If you have any questions, don't hesitate
			to <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a> Enjoy!~
