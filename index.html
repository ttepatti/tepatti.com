<!-- I've come to realize something.
 - What's the fun in some bootstrapped nice-looking website?
 - Websites should have your personality embedded in them, not
 - some stupid website template. And thus, this website was
 - born. -->

			<p>I'm going to be completely honest here, I find the notion of a "normal" or "professional" website to be boring.
			<br />
			Websites should be an extension of yourself, an extension of your personality.
			<br />
			You won't find any parallax scrolling here, you won't find any bootstrap themes, nothing like that.
			<br />
			But with those words in mind, I welcome you to my website.</p>
