		  I. Love. This. Car.
		  <br />
		  I have no reasonable reason to like this car in the slightest. Traditionally, I've hated front wheel drive cars. I thought
		  all Honda Civics were just driving pieces of bondo with a spoiler straight out of Fast and Furious on the back. I was into
		  drifting, giant Japanese "VIP" sedans, things like that. But when this car popped up on Craigslist for $250, I couldn't
		  resist.
		  <br />
		  I had recently been doing research on a group of street racers in Japan known as the Kanjozoku. If you haven't heard of
		  them before, I highly recommend doing some reading/watching. <a href="http://thekanjozoku.com/">"The Kanjozoku, Osaka's
		  Famous Street Racers"</a> is probably the most famous documentary on the topic, and one of the only sources of information
		  you'll be able to find without putting in some heavy research. While they're getting more popular as time passes and 
		  information on them is becoming more and more readily available, it still boils down to them being a few small car shops
		  in Osaka who haven't <i>quite</i> made the transition to the internet yet. (That being said, they do have a small internet
		  presence - email me if you want a list of some Mechadock/Temple Racing/NoGood Instagram and Twitter accounts to follow)
		  <br /> <!-- TODO: Insert pictures of the civic on the right and left between these paragraphs. -->
		  So who are the Kanjozoku? They're street racers in Japan who almost solely race Civics. They strip them, cage them, and 
		  used to run from the police so often they would have to paint them nightly. Shaved off VIN numbers and no license plate
		  so they can abandon the cars if they're caught. Everything about them sounded straight out of a movie. What really caught
		  my eye was the use of their cars as a tool. They pushed small economy hatchbacks to the absolute limit and then pushed
		  them a little further, pushing the envelope of modifications people had tried with that platform. It was inspiring to watch
		  and really showed me the DIY potential of a cheap econobox car and some ingenuity, something that instantly appealed to me,
		  coming from a security background. One of the things I've loved about security is utilizing a normal computer to do things
		  "outside of the box" that aren't usually supposed to happen, so the attraction of racing a $250 economy car was too great to
		  ignore.
		  <br />
		  While I could write paragraphs on the different modifications I've done, problems I've run into, or annoyances I've had, it
		  would be wasted space as I maintain a build thread on Honda-Tech! The link is at the bottom of the page, you can follow
		  my updates from start to present and see the current state of the car.
