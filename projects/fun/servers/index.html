		  <p>
		  	  I've run different makeshift home servers for years. Honeypots, web servers, etc. Its really fun! I've learned tons about
		  	  running Linux in an enterprise and always-online fashion, running different kinds of server software (FTP, SSH, etc), and
		  	  more.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	  For hardware, I generally run my servers on various desktops and laptops. One of my favorite computers for running a tiny
		  	  home honeypot is the Dell Optiplex GX400 (the smallest chassis). It draws almost no power, has a Pentium 4 with Hyper
		  	  Threading(!), and had room for one hard drive and some DDR2 RAM. While not the most powerful platform ever, it could be
		  	  stuffed under a desk or on a shelf and was quiet as a mouse.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	  Later, I moved onto my "halftop". It was a Dell Latitude D620 with the screen ripped off and chassis painted. I had a monitor
		  	  mounted to my wall, so it was basically a full server/computer in the form factor of a keyboard, since all that was left was the
		  	  bottom half of the laptop! This was my favorite platform by far for running on my electronics work bench. I could work on Arduino
		  	  projects with my Arduino IDE and whatnot running on the half-top with the monitor nice and off the desk to give me more room
		  	  to work!
		  </p>
		  <img src="/img/projects/servers.jpg" align="left" class="website_img img-fluid w-50" alt="A pile of servers in the back of
		  my Ford Ranger"></img>
		  <p>
		  	  And finally, most recently, I've been running a Dell Poweredge 2800. This thing is a <i>jet engine</i>. I seriously can't
		  	  deal with it. Something is wrong with the fan controller, causing the fans to spin at 100% all the time. I worked on fixing
		  	  it for a while, but quickly realized that even with the dual 604-socket Xeons, the massive 1000w, dual-PSU server had less 
		  	  computing power than my desktop and its AMD FX-8350.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	  As such, I'm at a crossroads. I have my Poweredge 2800 currently listed on Craigslist, available for a low price. I'm hoping
		  	  to use the money to pick up some DDR3 ECC RAM, for another sever I was given. This one with an ATX-format SuperMicro motherboard
		  	  and a nice i5! The only issue is the missing RAM.
