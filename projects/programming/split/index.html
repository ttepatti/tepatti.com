		  Split was a project started at the Spartahack 2017 hackathon. The goal of the app was to create an
		  easy-to-use platform for splitting expenses, bills, or payments with friends and family. The idea was birthed
		  when our group of friends was out getting dinner together and had a single check given to us. "What if
		  we had an app that let us take a picture of the reciept and easily split the cost instead of messing with
		  cash and writing down who owes who?"
		  <br /><br />
		  I did a majority of the app development, while Lindsay Nichols and Jinwoo Kang created an attention-grabbing 
		  website, Shane Combs and Andrew Dartt worked on the server and backend databases, and Jack Parent created 
		  a beautiful logo and an easy-to-use UI for the application.
		  <br /><br />
		  <small>Huge shoutout to everyone on our team, the Spartahack organizers, and everyone who poked their head
		  in the door to say hi or give us feedback on the app!! :)</small>
		  <br /><br />
		  The app allowed users to join groups with their friends and then manage expenses in those groups. You could
		  be in a group with your roommates, the group you go out to lunch with, or even your best friend you always
		  lend money to. Using OCR technology, we allowed users to scan a picture of reciepts and then assign the
		  individual expenses on the reciept to different users in their groups. You could also optionally set a due
		  date for the expense ("Pay me back by X/X/XXXX") and the system would automatically give the other user
		  reminders when the due date was approaching.
		  <br /><br />
		  Overall, the full application was never completed, but it's a project I would love to come back to in the
		  future. The features were useful and I would use the app in my day-to-day life!
