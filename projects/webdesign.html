			I think that everyone should operate a website. It doesn't even have to be a
			particularly good website. Social media websites have stripped away a lot of
			the individuality that came with everyone operating their own little home
			in cyberspace.
		</p>
		<p>
			Websites used to be a highly personal thing. Geocities websites were works of
			art, even if half of them were flooded with horrible gifs and looked ugly as
			all heck, even back then. But what they had, even if ugly, was personality. No
			longer can you browse the internet and find someone's homepage completely dedicated
			to a certain type of soup, for example. Their SEO wouldn't be good enough to
			rank them high on Google, and as such, no one would find their website.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the past, this issue was solved with "web rings" - a big group of websites
			whose owners would all agree to link to each other. This allowed people who
			browsed one site to find others that they might like, a sort of personalized
			recommendation by the owner. But these don't exist anymore - or if they do,
			they exist sparsely, only on hobbyist nerd sites like mine. But these days,
			SEO rules all, and its for the worse.
		</p>
		<p>
			No longer can you find homepages or personal fan pages on the net. A Google search
			will never help you find the page you're reading right now, unless you know
			exactly what you're looking for. It's no longer possible to stumble upon small,
			unknown-to-most websites.
		</p>
		<p>
			But as they say - <b>you should lead by example.</b> Every single page on this
			website was crafted from scrath by hand. Want to check out the computers that
			aided me in writing this website?

			On top of that, this website is active in a web ring! If you'd like to join,
			I'd be happy to link to your site. Feel free to <a href="/contact.html">Contact
			Me!</a>
			Because that's the beauty of the web. Any person can load a text editor on their
			computer, or even phone, and make a website. It can be published for anyone to
			see in a matter of minutes. There are hundreds of free web hosts that can help
			you re-create what Geocities used to be, such as <a href="https://neocities.org">
			NeoCities!</a> (You should give them a visit, and maybe even make a website!)
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm in support of bringing the internet back to its roots. I'm sick of browsing
			only a select few shiny websites every day. I'd like to check out websites
			made by people I actually care about. I want to visit someone's homepage and see
			what updates they've made recently, what they've tweaked, how their homepage looks.
			And I decided to join that revolution by turning my homepage into a part of it.
