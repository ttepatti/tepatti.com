## Hello world?!
### 2019-10-11

This is my first blog post.

    Apparently, this is how you do inline code.
    You just have to indent with four spaces
    And you can even make it span multiple lines

## A section heading here

You can even write **bold text** using markdown.

## Really? What else??

There's probably *italics* and lots of other fun stuff that I haven't discovered yet.

Now I've gotta get to blogging!
