## About Me

Hello! My name is Tim, and I love computers. Everything about them, head to toe, start to finish. Old or new, weird or plain. I created this website to show off my personal projects, hobbies, and collections of interesting information!

I have a huge passion for computers, GNU/Linux, security, video games, retro computing, programming, networking, web design, anime, manga, cars, "JDM" culture, drifting, and so so much more. If any of that sounds cool to you, I highly recommend checking out my [various projects!]()

This website doesn't take itself too seriously, so don't be too surprised by the various designs or layouts. I made it for fun, because I love writing websites by hand :) For more information, you can check out the [web design page]().

Feel free to explore and have fun! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [contact me](). Enjoy!~
