- make it so links don't turn purple when clicked. If possible, control this on a theme-by-theme basis?
- possibly make it so that the user can select different themes for how they want to view my website
- add backgrounds and fun text colors to each page
- maybe add an optional music player using iframes? initially, it would only show a really really basic iframe with a simple "BOOT MUSIC PLAYER" button or something like that. When clicked, it would redirect to the "heavier" page that actually loads the music, but it would still keep it within the iframe. That way you could keep page load times down but still allow optional music for the intended browsing experience.
