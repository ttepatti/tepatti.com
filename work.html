					NEC PC-9801

				</th>
				<td>
					The PC-9801 was manufactured from 1982 to 2000 (Almost twenty years!!!)
					The machines are amazing and have one of the largest libraries of classic
					Japanese home-made ('doujin') games. Everything from Touhou to various
					early visual novels were available on these machines, making them great
					for collecting and exploring early examples of gaming in Japan.

					NEC PC-8800

					<img src="/images/pc8800.jpg" height="270" width="400"/>
				</th>
				<td>
					The NEC PC-8800 is the 9801's grandpa. This machine was released in 1981
					and featured the Zilog Z80, the same 8-bit processor you'd find in a TI-84
					calculator today.
					<br /><br />
					Don't let that dissuade you, though - the PC-8800 is an awesome machine
					with a huge library of classic home-made ('doujin') Japanese games to boot.
