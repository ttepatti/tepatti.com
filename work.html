		<h3>Current Work</h3>
		<p>I currently work for Aptiv PLC as a Cyber Security Lab Engineer. My day-to-day
			activities revolve around performing cyber security assessments on a variety of
			automotive products and platforms.</p>
		<p>Due to the sensitive nature of product security work I can't give many specifics
			about my assessments, but I have experience with a variety of embedded automotive 
			systems, standards, and operating systems. Any other relevant information should be 
			present on my resume :)</p>
		<h3>Resume</h3>

		copy of my resume. I'd be happy to send one your way :)</p>
